It's a system that uses Oracle tools to manage human resources within a company, with the software emphasizing the protection of stored data.
We fully install the security tools provided by Oracle, including:
- Authentication mechanisms, permission granting, and role assignment for each personnel within the company.
- OLS:
- Audit: tracks every employee access on each table.
- Utilizing mechanisms to initiate security policies, helping to limit the authority of each role based on the value of each data row.
- Utilizing RSA asymmetric encryption during packet transmission and reception, ensuring that information within the packets is not exposed during transit and that data stored in the database is ciphertext. While RSA makes it difficult for attackers to decrypt the ciphertext, it comes with a relatively high algorithm execution cost. Additionally, the key pairs are automatically generated and stored as output of hashing function in the keys folder."
